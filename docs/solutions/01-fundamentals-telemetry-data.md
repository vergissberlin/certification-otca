# Solution: Telemetry Data

## Solution Overview

This solution covers identifying and understanding the three types of telemetry data in the OpenTelemetry system: traces, metrics, and logs.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Task 1: Identify Telemetry Types

**Current Telemetry in System**:

- **Traces**: Generated by both Node.js and Python services via automatic instrumentation (Express/Flask) and manual spans
- **Metrics**: Counter metrics (`requests_total`) created in both services
- **Logs**: Not currently implemented (can be added)

**Key Differences**:

- **Traces**: Show request flows, timing, and relationships between operations
- **Metrics**: Show aggregated measurements over time (counts, rates, distributions)
- **Logs**: Show discrete events with timestamps and messages

### Task 2: Generate and Observe Traces

1. Generate traces:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/hello
curl http://localhost:5000/hello
```

1. In Jaeger UI (<http://localhost:16686>):
   - Click "Search" without filters
   - Select a service (e.g., "service-python")
   - Click "Find Traces"
   - Click on a trace to see:
     - Span hierarchy
     - Span timing
     - Span attributes
     - Trace timeline

### Task 3: Generate and Observe Metrics

1. Generate metrics by making multiple requests:

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do curl http://localhost:3000/hello; done
```

1. In Prometheus UI (<http://localhost:9090>):
   - Go to "Graph" tab
   - Query: `requests_total`
   - See metric values with labels
   - Try: `rate(requests_total[1m])` for request rate

### Task 4: Compare Traces vs Metrics

**Use Cases for Traces**:

- Debugging specific requests
- Understanding request flow
- Finding slow operations
- Identifying errors in specific requests

**Use Cases for Metrics**:

- Monitoring system health
- Alerting on thresholds
- Capacity planning
- Performance trends

**Examples from System**:

- Trace: "How long did this specific request take?" → Check Jaeger
- Metric: "How many requests per second?" → Query `rate(requests_total[1m])` in Prometheus

## Key Takeaways

- Traces provide detailed, request-level visibility
- Metrics provide aggregated, system-level visibility
- Use traces for debugging, metrics for monitoring
- Both are complementary and should be used together
